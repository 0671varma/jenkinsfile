1st - Create a Jenkins Scripted pipeline
This pipeline should do the below tasks
- it should clone the code from github
- it should build the code using maven (make sure to integrate the plugins)
- it should test the code using sonar analysis (use a sonar server - setup sonrqube)
- it should deploy the code to tomcat (create and setuup tomcat 1st - integrate this in the pipeline - use required plugins)

- Convert the Scripted pipeline into a Declarative script by creating a Jenkinsfile directly in the code repo
